# Project Title

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

-  What is importance of iterator?
-  How for loop is executed upon an iterable?
```
for item in _list:
    pass
```
Here list is an iterable, and when for loop is run upon an iterable
then inherently iter() function is executed and iterator is created.
In each step the next() function is being called to iterate over the sequence.

- Iterable vs iterator
